            Skeleton is a winter sport where athletes run and jump onto a sledge, belly down, and speed off down a track, using their legs and shoulders to control their direction. It’s similar to luge, except the athlete is racing head first, as opposed to being on their back.
            is one of the three sliding sports at Beijing 2022, alongside the luge and bobsleigh. The competition only has two events – the men’s and women’s singles – meaning only  just  medals are up for grabs, making competition for a podium spot fierce.
            Both the men’s and women’s competitions consist of four runs over two days that are added together, and the athlete with the fastest combined time is the winner.
